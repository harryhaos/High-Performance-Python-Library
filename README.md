# High-Performance-Python-Library
A collective list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries and software for High Performance. Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python).

## Interpreters

* [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) - An implementation of Python in Python. The interpreter uses black magic to make Python very fast without having to add in additional type information.
* [Stackless Python](http://www.stackless.com/) - An enhanced version of the Python.
* [Pyston](https://github.com/dropbox/pyston) - A Python implementation built using LLVM and modern JIT techniques with the goal of achieving good performance.

## Library

* [Cython](http://cython.org/) - Optimizing Static Complier for Python. Uses type mixins to compile Python into C or C++ modules resulting in large performance gains.

## JIT

*[Numpile](https://github.com/sdiehl/numpile) - A tiny 1000 line LLVM-based numeric specializer for scientific Python code.
*[cpmoptimize](https://github.com/borzunov/cpmoptimize) - Decorator for automatic algorithms optimization via fast matrix exponentiation
